# Changing brightness in Asahi Linux in a WM

* Make sure you have the Asahi-edge kernel installed
* Install light with

```
paru -S light
```

* Then add this or something similar into your WM config file (I use Qtile)

```
    Key(
        [],
        "XF86MonBrightnessUp",
        lazy.spawn("light -A 1"),
        desc="Brightness Up",
    ),
    Key(
        [],
        "XF86MonBrightnessDown",
        lazy.spawn("light -U 1"),
        desc="Brightness Down",
    ),
```
