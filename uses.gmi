# Software and hardware that I use

## Software:
=> https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty Alacritty
  My preferred terminal emulator. It's fast, has Ueberzug support, and is extremely configurable.

=> https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ Emacs
  My preferred text editor. It's very customizable and extensible, and might as well be an entire operating system

=> https://fishshell.com/ Fish Shell
  My preferred shell, it has a lot of things out of the box such as syntax highlighting and autocomplete

=> https://brave.com/ Brave Browser
   Free Internet Money

=> https://www.orgroam.com/ Org Roam
  A great plugin for Vim and Neovim that I use to take all my notes in.

=> https://github.com/davatorium/rofi Rofi
  A nice app launcher

=> https://github.com/qtile/qtile Qtile
  My favorite tiling window manager.

=> https://material-shell.com/ Gnome with Material Shell
  I actually really like using this, switch between this and Qtile regularly.

## Hardware:
  M1 Macbook Air 
  Got this back when I knew nothing about computers and how good Linux was, I run Asahi Linux on it now and am verry happy with it.

  I just wanted something that wasn't the Macbook keyboard.
